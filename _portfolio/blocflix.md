## Explanation

BlocJams stores album information and plays songs within the albums. Originaly created with vanilla javascript, refactored with jQuery, and then remade with AngularJS, the application stores albums and plays music based on user input. The application consist of a homepage, a collection page filled with stored albums, and the album page that displays the album itself along with each song the album contains. When a song is selected, a responsive player bar actively displays the current song. 

## Problem

This is a problem that caused me to come up with BlocJams. Essentially, this section is the client's request taken and broken down into a list of problems. This is where we define our problems. A pseudocode of sorts.

## Solution

In here, we take each problem listed above and discuss how we solved it, or if we solved it.

## Results

BlocJams plays music. 

> This project was amazing. - AverageUserMonthly Magazine

> OMG IT PLAYS MUSIC! - Captain Morthan Obvious

> 4 stars! - An astronomer counting Aries in the sky

## Conclusion

BlocJams can play music, skip songs, replay them. Doubts I had stemmed from never coding before. I learned javascript and jQuery and the difference between the two.
