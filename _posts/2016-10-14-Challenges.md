It feels amazing to be given a problem and being given the freedom to solve it all your own. It fills you with pride and a sense of accomplishment like no other. It also burns you out in a way that makes you feel like you'll never be able to do it again. 

I love diving head first into problems, but I often find myself no noticing that I cannot continue. I will keep going and get no where. I've learned that taking a break, napping, or just doing something totally mind numbing can often lead to a new way of thinking that can also bring forth the solutions you are seeking. 

Learning languages and libraries and frameworks takes more than just a little light reading here and there. Practice makes perfect, which is why I am a big fan of __codewars__, __codepen__, and __repl.it__. You only need to succeed once, but in the meantime you have those three sites to help push through to the ceiling.
