It's been tough. I sort of wish coding school advertisements did not make it sound like this is something you just sign up to do and you'll get these particular results. You have to work, and toil, and dissappoint yourself time and time again until you can rise to look like half a coder, and then eventually make something of yourself. 

Having a mentor really helps. Mentor meetings leave me feeling reenergized. I can't remember a mentor meeting I did not look forward to, except maybe for my first one. I get my questions answered and my mentor focuses more on teaching me _how to fish_ rather than just giving me a fish. 

I'll soon have my first project completed, and I can't wait to see it.
